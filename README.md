# Germany-Wind-Energy

This project contains three data sets, shapefile data, and a Jupyter notebook. 
One data set is sourced from the ENTSO-E portal and includes hourly wind energy generation in Germany.
Two data sets are sourced from NASA MERRA-2 and include hourly wind speed measurements in Germany. 
The shapefile data are used to obtain the plot of Germany. 
The Jupyter notebook contains all python code used for data cleaning and analysis. The notebook includes comments that describe each section of code. 
Data from the year 2016 were used to train a Bayesian linear regression model to predict hourly wind energy generation in the year 2017.  

## Useage

The code in the notebook can be executed using the JupyterLab application.
